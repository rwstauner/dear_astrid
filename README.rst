Dear Astrid,
============

| We've been together for a long time.
|
| I've enjoyed your happy little face,
| your nagging voice,
| and your persistence in keeping me on track.
|
| But now you've given yourself over to some yahoos,
| and I can't bear to see what will become of you.
|
| So, my precious little squid,
| I'm leaving you for `a monkey named Bob <http://rememberthemilk.com>`_.
